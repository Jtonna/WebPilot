Previously, tabs were placed in a blue-colored group named 'WebPilot'.

The await fix (commit 0302d41) is correct and resolves the race condition in our code. The remaining visual issue — tab group title/color not rendering until user interaction — is a confirmed Chrome 145 rendering bug. The API succeeds (verified via chrome.tabGroups.get() returning correct title and color), but Chrome does not repaint the tab group UI. This is fixed in Chrome 146. No further code changes needed on our side.","created_at":"2026-02-26T16:46:15Z"}]}
