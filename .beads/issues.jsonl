Previously, tabs were placed in a blue-colored group named 'WebPilot'.

The await fix (commit 0302d41) is correct and resolves the race condition in our code. The remaining visual issue — tab group title/color not rendering until user interaction — is a confirmed Chrome 145 rendering bug. The API succeeds (verified via chrome.tabGroups.get() returning correct title and color), but Chrome does not repaint the tab group UI. This is fixed in Chrome 146. No further code changes needed on our side.","created_at":"2026-02-26T16:46:15Z"}]}

{"id":"WebPilot-c7s","title":"Restricted mode: domain whitelist with default-block-all","description":"EMERGENCY SECURITY FEATURE. Add a restricted mode toggle (ON by default) that blocks ALL WebPilot MCP commands on any site not in a user-managed whitelist. Scope: (1) Extension-level block — any MCP command involving a tab is rejected if the tab domain is not whitelisted. (2) Rejection message returned to AI agent: 'Blocked: [domain] is not whitelisted. The human must manually add this site to the whitelist in the WebPilot extension before automation can proceed.' (3) Domain-level granularity — e.g. yahoo.com covers all subdomains and paths. (4) UI in extension popup: restricted mode ON/OFF toggle, button to whitelist/remove current site, editable list of all whitelisted domains. (5) Storage in chrome.storage.local. (6) Default state: ON — all sites blocked until manually whitelisted.
