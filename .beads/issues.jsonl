Add a restricted mode toggle (ON by default) that blocks ALL WebPilot MCP commands on any site not in a user-managed whitelist.

The human must manually add this site to the whitelist in the WebPilot extension before automation can proceed.' (3) Domain-level granularity — e.g. yahoo.com covers all subdomains and paths. (4) UI in extension popup: restricted mode ON/OFF toggle, button to whitelist/remove current site, editable list of all whitelisted domains. (5) Storage in chrome.storage.local.
